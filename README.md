dipc
====

A damn lightweight IPC implementation worked on windows. It's using shared memory and windows event, yes, it's rude and stupid, but it works.  

Only one-to-one model supported, one server answer one client at once.  
For one-to-many model, checkout `on-to-many` branch.

How to use?
-----------
Just include `ipc.c` and `icp.h` into your project.
